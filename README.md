# Talon Mouse Glider: Scroll by moving the pointer!

Talon Mouse Glider allows you to scroll by uttering "mouse glide" and then moving the mouse pointer. It even adds scrolling inertia for a scrolling experience similar to scrolling gestures in macos!

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/antman261/talon-mouse-glider.git ~/.talon/user/mouse-glider
```

### Windows

```
cd %AppData%\Talon\user
git clone https://github.com/antman261/talon-mouse-glider.git mouse-glider
```

## Usage

1. Utter `mouse glide` or `glider` to activate mouse gliding.
2. Use your pointing device (trackpad, mouse, etc) to scroll
3. Utter `glide stop` or `glider` to deactivate mouse gliding and return to moving the pointer.

## Possible Features & Improvements

* Vertical-only glide mode
* Horizontal-only glide mode
